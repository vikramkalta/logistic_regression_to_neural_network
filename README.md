# Logistic Regression Learning Project

This project is designed to help understand logistic regression through visualization and hands-on implementation. It uses a simple, squiggly line dataset to demonstrate how logistic regression works.

## Project Structure
- `logistic_regression.py`: Main implementation of logistic regression
- `visualization.py`: Visualization utilities
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project
Run the main script:
```bash
python logistic_regression.py
```

This will generate visualizations showing:
1. The original dataset
2. Logistic regression decision boundary
3. Learning process visualization
